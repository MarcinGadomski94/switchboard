### NewSession
```json
{ "name": "free-talk-640", "task": "…", "workType": "feature|qa", "mode": "single|orchestrator",
  "solutions": ["acme-app-front","mobile"], "phase": "ui-first|integration",
  "coordination": "sequential|parallel-twin|none|null", "qa": { "stack": "web|mobile|both", "confluenceUrl": "", "figmaUrls": [] } ,
  "worktrees": true, "ultracode": false }
```
Validation: name unique and kebab-case; solutions not empty; read-only paths are rejected (422); `qa` is required when workType = qa.

## Event hub `/hub` (Server-Sent Events)
Transport changed from SignalR to **Server-Sent Events** on 2026-09-27 (developer ruling, Node stack). Event names and payloads are unchanged and remain locked.
`GET /hub` → `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, cookie-authenticated like every API call. Each event is sent as
```
event: <name>
data: <payload as one line of camelCase JSON>

```
A `: keepalive` comment is sent at least every 15 s. All client → server traffic stays REST.

| Event | Payload |
|---|---|
| sessionUpdated | Session |
| event | { sessionId, event: Event } |
| questionBatch | { sessionId, batchId, questions: Question[] } → UI plays the sound, shows a toast and sends an OS notification |
| inboxChanged | { count } |
| worktreeRemovable | Worktree |
| scheduleRun | { scheduleId, result } |
| system | same shape as GET /api/system, every 5 s |

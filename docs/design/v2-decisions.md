# Switchboard 2: the assumptions log (all lanes)

The developer asked for v2 to be built without questions (D131, `docs/decisions.md`). Every lane records here what it had to decide on its own: one line per assumption, **ASSUMED** first, then why. The orchestrator reviews them at the end; anything the developer overrules becomes a fix.

Format: `- **ASSUMED** <what>. <why>. (lane, date)`

## Lane F · Foundation (2026-10-25)

### Branching and structure
- **ASSUMED** the lane branches are named `v2-<lane>` (`v2-foundation`), not `v2/<lane>`: git cannot hold `refs/heads/v2/foundation` while a branch `v2` exists. Lane G already used `v2-graduation`. (F)
- **ASSUMED** all v2 code lives under `src/web/v2/`; the only classic files touched are the boot (`main.tsx`, the new `Root.tsx` and `theme.ts`), `router.tsx` (its value also carries the raw `pathname`), `shell/Panes.tsx` (`loadPaneState` takes the boot's settings read) and classic Settings (a new **Appearance** section). (F)
- **ASSUMED** v2 CSS never meets classic CSS: every v2 token is named `--v2-*` and defined on `<html data-ui="v2">`, every rule is scoped under `.sb2` (the v2 root) and every class starts with `v2-`. Both UIs' code is on the page at once (the switch needs no reload), so names must not collide. (F)
- **ASSUMED** the v2 UI's code is a separate chunk, loaded before the first render when v2 is the boot theme (no flash) and fetched when the browser is idle otherwise (an instant switch). (F)

### The theme switch
- **ASSUMED** the per-browser choice is `localStorage['switchboard.ui.theme']` (`v2` / `classic`); without one, the service's `ui.theme` (default `v2`) applies. A phone is a browser like any other. (F)
- **ASSUMED** `SWITCHBOARD_UI_THEME_DEFAULT` (`v2` / `classic`) sets the service's default until `ui.theme` is stored. The E2E test servers set `classic`, so every spec written before v2 keeps testing the classic UI; v2 specs opt in (`tests/e2e/v2-world.ts`). (F)
- **ASSUMED** classic Settings gets a new **Appearance** section (after Notifications & usage) with the Theme switch and "Default for new browsers" (shown, or "Make … the default"). v2's twin is `settings/ThemeRow.tsx` (lane R places it). (F)
- **ASSUMED** switching replaces the current history entry with the other UI's address for the same page (`toV2Path` / `toClassicPath`); where the other UI has no such page the address is kept and that UI shows its default page. (F)
- **ASSUMED** the placeholder pages' "Open the classic page" switches this browser to Classic (the same switch as Settings), so it persists until switched back. (F)
- **ASSUMED** v2's light / dark follows the system by default; Settings › Appearance may fix it per browser (`localStorage['switchboard.v2.scheme']`). Classic stays dark only. (F)

### Routes
- **ASSUMED** the v2 addresses: `/` Home, `/needs-you`, `/agents` (`?show=closed` = closed agents, the classic History), `/agents/:id[/changes|results|timeline|helpers]`, `/agents/:id/helpers/:helperId[/events/:eventId]`, `/agents/:id/results/:resultId`, `/agents/:id/events/:eventId`, `/projects[/:id]`, `/crews[/:id]`, `/results`, `/search?q=`, `/insights`, `/settings[/usage|computers|phones|rules|appearance|advanced[/<classic section>]]`, `/notes`, `/routines`, `/tasks`, `/tools/:id`, `/share`, and `/more` (the phone's More tab). (F)
- **ASSUMED** classic → v2: `/inbox` → `/needs-you`, `/sessions/…` → `/agents/…` (Diff → Changes, Artifacts → Results, agents → helpers), `/plans` → `/projects`, `/team` → `/crews` (`/team/all` → `/crews`), `/artifacts` → `/results`, `/memory` → `/notes`, `/todos` → `/tasks`, `/schedules` → `/routines`, `/history` → `/agents?show=closed`, `/solutions` → `/settings/advanced/code-projects`, `/mcp` → `/settings/advanced/connections`, `/settings/accounts|machines|devices` → `/settings/usage|computers|phones`, any other classic section → `/settings/advanced/<key>`; v2 → classic the reverse (`/settings/rules` → `/settings/sessions`, where the standing instruction is). (F)

### Needs you
- **ASSUMED** no new server route is needed: `GET /api/inbox` (already merging paired computers), `GET /api/team/needs-you?teamId=all`, `GET /api/memory/entries?scope=` and `GET /api/system` cover every source. System items are told apart by their action ids and labels (`plan-merge` / `merge-pr` → ready, `plan-ask-repos` → pick code projects, `retry-run` → routine failed, `open-memory` → notes, `Stopped` / `CI keeps failing` → stopped, `turn-waiting` → ask). (F)
- **ASSUMED** an answer waits 5 s before it is sent, so the toast's **Undo** really takes it back; it is sent at once when the page is hidden or closed. (F)
- **ASSUMED** a folder's "N memory proposals" item is replaced by one card per proposed note (Approve / Edit first / Reject); if its notes cannot be read, the summary item stays with its Review link. (F)
- **ASSUMED** usage alerts (an account out of usage, or paying from paid extra usage) are derived from `GET /api/system` and dismissed per browser (`localStorage['switchboard.v2.dismissedAlerts']`); the server has no such item. (F)
- **ASSUMED** "Go ahead" on an agent's ask sends `Go ahead.`; **Try again** on a stopped step sends `Please try again and finish the task.` and dismisses the item; **Send back** on a ready plan step uses the plan's send-back (found by the item's run session), else a message to the agent. (F)
- **ASSUMED** an access request's **Add key** opens `/crews/<crew>?member=<id>&tab=access` (lane P: honour these query keys); **Not now** declines it. A gate or budget request is an approval (Approve / Deny). (F)
- **ASSUMED** the rail's badges: Home = everything waiting; Agents = items of agents that are neither a teammate nor a project step; Projects = project steps' items (and pick code projects); Crews = teammates' items. Results and Settings have none. (F)

### Shell
- **ASSUMED** every v2 overlay (menu, popover, dialog, sheet, drawer) renders into one overlay layer at the end of the v2 root (`components/Portal.tsx`), not into `<body>`: it keeps the `.sb2` scope and the React context. (F)
- **ASSUMED** the status pill's usage meters say **5 hours** and **Week** (the prototype says "Today"): the window is five hours, not a day. (F)
- **ASSUMED** the Pinned list is the shared sidebar layout's pins (sessions only; closed ones hidden). (F)
- **ASSUMED** the shell owns ⌘K, ⌘⇧F and `?`, and emits ⌘. (side panel, lane S) and ⌘\\ (folder tree, lane A) to the page that registered `useShortcut(…)`; Esc (stop the agent) and number keys belong to the pages and the answer cards. (F)
- **ASSUMED** the "unread" and "draft" markers are building blocks only: the service has no unread state yet, so the lanes decide when to show them. (F)
- **ASSUMED** no What's-new tour for Lane F: lane X adds "Welcome to Switchboard 2" (the plan's Phase 2). (F)

### Tests
- **ASSUMED** `tests/e2e/settings.spec.ts`'s section list also gains **Processes** (D127), which it was missing (it failed before v2), besides **Appearance**. (F)
- **ASSUMED** `tests/e2e/responsive.spec.ts` › *phone landscape 640×360 › menus fit the window* fails on the `v2` base too (the classic sidebar ⋯ menu ends 1 px below the window); not touched by lane F. (F)

## Lane G · Graduation (D132)

- **ASSUMED G1 · branch name.** The brief asked for `v2/graduation`, but git cannot create `refs/heads/v2/graduation` while the integration branch `v2` exists (a ref cannot be both a branch and a folder). Lane G works on **`v2-graduation`** (cut from `v2`).
- **ASSUMED G2 · stored switches: delete once at start.** The three 1.x keys (`experimental.team`, `experimental.plans`, `experimental.memory`) are ignored (no longer known settings) and deleted at every start by `forgetGraduatedSwitches` (idempotent, so it is effectively one-time). No migration: they are settings values, not schema. `PUT /api/settings` now refuses them with 422 like any unknown key.
- **ASSUMED G3 · the Jira connection gets its own section.** Settings → Experimental held only the three switches and, under the Plans row, the Jira connection. With the switches gone the section had nothing switchable left, so it is removed and the Jira connection moved to a new classic section **Settings → Jira** (`/settings/jira`, placed where Experimental was, before Clean-up); `/settings/experimental` resolves to it so old links and bookmarks still land somewhere sensible. Lane R may reuse or embed it in the v2 Settings → Advanced.
- **ASSUMED G4 · the sidebar's team entry for an untouched Team.** Team always has its first team (`team.db` creates it), so turning Team on for everyone would add "⚑ Team · 0 members" above SESSIONS for users who never used Team. The entry now stays hidden while only the first team exists with its default name and no member (`untouchedTeams`, `src/web/team/sidebar-roster.ts`); a member, a rename or a second team shows it as before. The nav grid's Team cell is always there (that is how Team is reached).
- **ASSUMED G5 · the nav grid grows to eleven cells.** With Plans, Team and Memory always on, the classic nav grid has eleven cells (three rows of five instead of two) for users who had any of them off. Not changed (the cells are how the features are reached; v2 has its own rail).
- **ASSUMED G6 · plans paused by a 1.x switch-off stay paused.** A plan that 1.x paused when Plans was switched off keeps its "Plans was switched off" reason until the developer resumes it, exactly as switching Plans on did in 1.x. Nothing resumes by itself on upgrade.
- **ASSUMED G7 · demo mode unchanged.** Demo mode still does not run Team, Plans or Project memory (their state answers `enabled: false` there, as before); with `SWITCHBOARD_DEMO_EXTRAS=1` Team and Plans run for the README screenshots. Lane X owns how the demo seed renders in v2.
- **ASSUMED G8 · the state routes keep `enabled`.** `GET /api/{team,plans,memory}/state` still answers `enabled` (always `true` outside demo mode) so a 1.x peer or an older page reading them keeps working; `available` remains the field that matters (false only for a broken database).
- **ASSUMED G9 · a What's-new tour for the graduation.** Existing installs that had the features off would otherwise see three new sidebar cells unexplained, so a short `graduated` tour (D132, version 2.0.0) points at the Plans, Team and Memory cells and says Settings → Experimental is gone and the Jira connection moved. Lane X's "Welcome to Switchboard 2" tour is separate; the orchestrator may merge them.
- **ASSUMED G10 · the removal docs stay as the wiring map.** `docs/*-removal.md` became short "graduated" notes that keep the hook table (file → hook) as *How it is wired*; the `removal.test.ts` files still check the markers against those tables. The 1.x step-by-step removal procedure is in the files' git history.

## Lane A · Agents (Tasks)

- **ASSUMED** the board's four columns map onto the service's three todo states: **Open** = `open`; **In progress** = `in_progress` while its working agent runs (`status: run`) or is not known yet; **Review** = `in_progress` whose working agent (its active run agent, else its own agent) is known and has stopped (any status but `run`); **Done** = `done`. D102 removed the stored `review` state, and an in-progress task whose agent has stopped is exactly the one waiting for the developer to check it. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** nothing can be moved *into* Review (it is derived, not a state): the ⋯ menu and the detail dialog offer Move to Open / In progress / Done only, as `PUT …/todos/{id} { state }` with a toast Undo that puts the previous state back. No drag and drop in this pass. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** the card's "so far" time is the ended spans (`actualMs`) plus the running one since `startedAt`, ticking every 30 s; the server only adds a span when it ends (D78). A done card says `took …` from `actualMs`; a task moved straight from Open to Done has no actual and shows only its estimate. Over-estimate time turns the line amber with a clock icon. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** the Done column's line is "Estimates were N% accurate on M completed tasks.", from every agent's D78 `actuals` (100% minus the relative error of the summed actual time against the summed estimates), not the prototype's "this week": the API keeps per-session totals without dates. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** the quick add is a D81 capture (`POST …/todos/capture`, `from: palette`, so the agent fills in the description, plan, priority and estimate when idle) into the agent picked in the **Add to …** select next to the field, defaulting to the most recently active open agent (`captureTargets`, the palette's order). A leading `task ` is dropped (the palette's command word); a long text keeps the whole text as the note. The toast's Undo deletes the new task. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** a delete hides the card at once and is sent after the toast's 5.6 s Undo window (Undo cancels it; leaving the page or closing the tab sends it at once), like Needs you's answers; classic deletes at once without Undo. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** Start here and Run in its own agent are disabled with the reason ("Studio-PC is offline", "Reconnecting to Studio-PC…") when the task's agent is on a paired computer that is not online; Run is also disabled while an agent of its own already works on the task. Start here keeps classic's fallback for a paired computer on 1.11 or older (the start message as a plain message). (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** the import dialog lists only open agents that are not conversations (classic's rule), most recently active first; it opens on Jira (the prototype's first source) and explains when Jira is not connected. Its pure parts are classic's `src/web/ci/import-issues.ts`. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** the description and the handover plan show in a detail dialog (title click or ⋯ → Details) as plain pre-wrapped text, not rendered Markdown: v2 has no shared Markdown block yet. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** layouts: desktop ≥ 1280 four columns; tablet 768–1279 two columns (2 × 2); phone ≤ 767 one column at a time with a segmented switcher (Open / In progress / Review / Done with counts) above the board. (A, 2026-10-25)
- **ASSUMED** the page title is the v2 page heading ("Tasks" + its sub line) rather than the prototype's crumb ("Tasks · estimate vs actual") inside the Agents screen: `/tasks` is its own page in v2. No What's-new tour entry: lane X's "Welcome to Switchboard 2" covers v2's pages. (A, 2026-10-25)
